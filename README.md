## Project Planning

The first step in launching this app was utilyzing Github's built-in project management system.
Each step was laid out on a Kanban board.

## Planning Features and Debugging

When thinking about how to improve our project moving forward we came to a few conclusions:

- We would need to incorporate JDBC and connect it to a SQL Database to improve search functionality
- Convert our project into a Springboot MVC based project that would allow user's to interact with an interface
- By converting our project into a Springboot application we would also be able to automate testing with Postman
