The first step in launching this app was utilyzing Github's built-in project management system.
Each step was laid out on a Kanban board.

When thinking about how to make my project user friendly, I took a lot of care in designing the layout of my project.
As seen in this screenshot, there are 6 classes.
- AccountingLedgerApp: Here you'll find my main method and all of the Screens for my app.
- HomeFunctions: Stores all of the functioning code for my homeScreen.
- LedgerFunctions: Stores all of the functioning code for my ledgerScreen.
- ReportsFunctions: Stores all of the functioning code for my reportsScreen.
- Transaction: A class for constructing and getting my private Transaction values.
- Reader: A class for storing my buffered/file readers.
